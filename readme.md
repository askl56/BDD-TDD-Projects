**Javascript/Python/Scala BDD**

After working on RSPEC for a long time, I am curious to see other testing architectures and expand my knowledge of other languages through it. I wish I had learnt TDD through RSpec to begin with, so I am starting to do so now with other languages. Will upload all individual testing projects here.Â
